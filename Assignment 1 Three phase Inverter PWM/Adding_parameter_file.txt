1. Create parameter.m file in the same directory (preffered)
2. Include all the variables with semicolon as seperation (eg: Vdc = 200;)
3. Save it
4. Goto simulink - Modeling - Model settings - Model properties - Callbacks - PreLoadFcn
5. Write the command to include the file to simulink
   run('path\parameter.m')
Note: Better to include the full file path
6. Reload the simulink, parameters are available across the workspace
