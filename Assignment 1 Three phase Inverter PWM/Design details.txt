- Homework 1:
Implement a 3-phase inverter in Simulation (Plexim preferred, otherwise plain simulink) to produce 3-phase sinusoidal output.
Specs:
400V DC link (200+200)
10kHz switching frequency
Use ideal MOSFETS/IGBT models
Modulation index should be variable through a user input (knob)
Model should be parameterised, i.e. most parameters should be in one parameter file somewhere.
Connect an RL load on each phase, from the inverter pole to the DC midpoinf.
Take the R/L value to be such that Ï„>10*Tsw and peak current is about 2.5A
Model should be in Fixed-time step; step time of ~1us

LC circuit Design

L/R = time constant = 10*T of sawtooth (Carrier)
R = peak voltage/Current = 200/2.5 = 80
L = 10*(1/10*10e3)*80 = 0.08H
